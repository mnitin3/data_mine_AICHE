# Data Mining - AIChE National Meeting technical program

Mine the data in the AIChE National Meeting technical program to answer the following questions: 
 
  Treat the talks in the Food, Pharmaceutical and Bioengineering Division
    How many talks are from industry versus academia?
    What are some of the key themes/concepts that are being discussed within the reference corpus?

  Treat the rest of the data in the AIChE Technical program as a design corpus
    What are some of the themes being discussed in the design corpus?  (achieved by mining the talk title, session title and abstract if
    available)
    How are they different or similar to the topics discussed in the reference corpus?
